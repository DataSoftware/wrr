There are three zipped folders and one excel file entitled 'Drainage pipe data' here:
1. The excel file 'Drainage pipe data' contains the drainage system data of the study area
such as manholes and pipes.
2. The folder 'calibration and validation' contains the data for model calibration and validation
used in the study. The details can be found in the 'Readme' file in the folder.
3. The folder 'fvcom and pipe model' contains the modified source code (including the drainage pipe model)
of the FVCOM model. To use it, replace the original files with the same name in the FVCOM model by the modified ones.
4. The folder 'rainfall pattern data' contains the rainfall intensity data of different rainfall
patterns.
